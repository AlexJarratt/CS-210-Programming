# CS-210-Programming

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  The Project was on Corner Grocer taking inventory of all items purchased from open to close.

What did you do particularly well?
  I feel like I did well on the Histogram and the process of making it from the frequency file.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  I could probably make the menu loop more efficient and add a few exceptions to make it more secure.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  The most challenging part of the code to write was the Python functions. I overcame this by studying the material for the week and the various additional work I had then.
  I'm adding Stack Overflow as a fantastic resource to my support network.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  The coding methods are transferable. What I mean is the process on coding projects and my course work are highly transferable.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  This code is mantainable, readable, and adaptable by simply changing what's in the grocery_items file and the frequency.dat file. Additionally, there are in-line comments to 
  guide the individual to read the code. It is adaptable by changing from counting grocery items to counting change, where it could count pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters
  and how much each deposit of cents is. Furthermore, the highest frequency of cent type is able to be found and is useful data for a bank. This allows the bank to stock that cent
  type more frequently.
